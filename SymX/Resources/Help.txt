Command line switches applicable to ALL modes:

OUTPUT OPTIONS:

-quiet [-q]: Quiet mode. Find nothing without making too much noise.
-verbose [-v]: Verbose mode. Find nothing going out in a blaze of glory!
-logtofile [-l, -log]: Log output to file. This respects -q and -v.
-outfile [-out, -o]: If a file is found, rename it after download to the filename specified. If it already exists, a number will be appended to the filename.
-dontgeneratetempfile [-dt, -dtemp]: If this option is set, the temporary text file containing the successfully downloaded URLs will not be generated.

SEARCHING AND DOWNLOAD OPTIONS:

-dontdownload [-d]: Generate list of URLs and exit, msdlurlgen 1.1 style!
-maxretries [-retries, -max, -m]: Number of times to retry downloading a file before giving up. Default is 8.
-useragentversion [-uaversion] and useragentvendor [-uavendor]: Override the user agent. If you are downloading from a custom server that requires a specific useragent, this may be helpful.
Ignored if the default symbol server is specified.
-outfolder [-of]: Folder to output downloaded files to. Default is a "download" folder in the current working directory.
-symbolserverurl [-symsrvurl, -symsrv]: Alternative URL to try and acquire files from. The default value is http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols, the Microsoft symbol server. 
Must be a real symbol server (such as http://symbolserver.unity3d.com/ or https://driver-symbols.nvidia.com).

MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS:

-keepoldlogs [-keeplogs, -k]: Do not automatically delete old log files.
-nologo: Don't print versioning information before running. Ignores verbosity.
-inipath [-ini]: Load configuration options from a custom INI path instead of the default SymX.ini.
